How to install the Advene prototype

* Requirements:

** Video player

The video player is implemented on all platforms with the gstreamer
framework, through the python-gstreamer module (>= 0.10).

** Linux version

You will need the following python packages (the package names are from
Debian, they may slightly vary on other distributions) :

python >= 2.7
python-gi
gir1.2-gstreamer-1.0
python-gi-cairo
gir1.2-gtk-3.0 (>=3.4)
gir1.2-webkit-3.0
gir1.2-goocanvas-2.0
gir1.2-rsvg-2.0
python-cherrypy3 (>=3.0.0) [for convenience, a copy of cherrypy may be included in this Advene distribution]
python-simpletal (>=3.12) [for convenience, a copy of simpletal may be
included in this Advene distribution]

For gstreamer, it is useful to also install the gstreamer packages
needed to decode various formats (esp. gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad and
gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly).

Note that all these dependencies are already available in Debian and
in standard installations of Ubuntu.

When running on virtual machines (parallels, virtualbox...) : you must
select the X11 video output in Edit/Preferences/Video Player.

** Windows version

If you want to run Advene from sources on win32, you should install in this order (note the version numbers) :

Python2  >=  v. 2.7 : http://python.org/

win32process from http://pywin32.sf.net/

Python bindings for gtk/gstreamer and underlying libs from
https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/PyGObject enabling support for
 - gtk
 - cairo
 - gstreamer
 - rsvg
 - webkit
 - goocanvas

Optionally,

CherryPy: http://download.cherrypy.org/cherrypy/ [for
convenience, a copy of cherrypy is included in this Advene
distribution]

SimpleTAL (>=3.12) :
http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/download.html [for
convenience, a copy of simpletal is included in this Advene
distribution]

** Mac OS X version

The new Advene code has not yet been tested in Mac OS X environement,
for lack of dedicated hardware. You can consider a donation :-) or try
yourself to install dependencies (python-gi, gtk, gstreamer) using the
linux install information.

* Testing

You can run the script ./bin/advene directly from the source
directory. It will detect that it is running from sources and adapt
its paths to this location.

In a first step, you can try the Advene application without movie player
support by using the "-pdummy" parameter :

  advene -pdummy

To force the use of the gstreamer player, specify:

  advene -pgstreamer

To force the use of the vlc player, specify:

  advene -pvlctypes

* Installing

To install the application, you can run the setup.py script with
appropriate options. For a standard installation, run

  python setup.py install

Note that it is not necessary to install the application to run it. It
can be used directly from its sources directory.

* Documentation

An (incomplete) user guide is in the public Advene wiki, feel free to contribute:

A summarized list of changes across versions is available in the
CHANGES.txt file.
