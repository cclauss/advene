How to install the Advene prototype

* Requirements:

** Video player

The video player is implemented on all platforms with the gstreamer
framework, through the python-gstreamer module (>= 0.10).

** Linux version

You will need the following python packages (the package names are from
Debian, they may slightly vary on other distributions) :

python >= 2.7
python-gtk2 (>=2.24)
python-cherrypy3 (>=3.0.0) [for convenience, a copy of cherrypy may be included in
this Advene distribution]
python-simpletal (>=3.12) [for convenience, a copy of simpletal may be
included in this Advene distribution] 

For the gstreamer plugin:
python-gst0.10
gstreamer0.10-plugins-base
gstreamer0.10-x
+ other gstreamer packages needed to decode various formats
(esp. gstreamer0.10-plugins-good and gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly).

Optionaly:
python-opencv (for some feature-extraction filters)

Note that all these dependencies are already available in Debian and
in standard installations of the Ubuntu Feisty Fawn (and later)
distribution.

** Windows version

If you want to run Advene from sources on win32, you should install in this order (note the version numbers) :

Python  >=  v. 2.7 : http://python.org/

Gstreamer SDK from http://gstreamer.com/ (choosing complete install to
get python bindings). It will install both Gstreamer and gtk (with
python bindings).

CherryPy: http://download.cherrypy.org/cherrypy/ [for
convenience, a copy of cherrypy is included in this Advene
distribution]

SimpleTAL (>=3.12) :
http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/download.html [for
convenience, a copy of simpletal is included in this Advene
distribution]

win32process from http://pywin32.sf.net/

Optionally, 
python-opencv

** Mac OS X version

From macports (http://www.macports.org/), install :

    * python26 or later [Note: after its install, make sure that
      /opt/local/bin/python exists, and that your path begins with
      /opt/local/bin. Else, the installation of the other packages
      could use the /usr/bin/python version]
    * py26-gtk (>= 2.12)
    * py26-goocanvas
    * librsvg (optional)
    * py26-pyobjc2 (optional)
    * py26-gst-python
    * gst-plugins-base
    * gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-bad gst-plugins-ugly
    * gst-ffmpeg

* Testing

You can run the script ./bin/advene directly from the source
directory. It will adapt its paths to this location.

In a first step, you can try the Advene application without movie player
support by using the "-pdummy" parameter :

  advene -pdummy

To force the use of the gstreamer player, specify:

  advene -pgstreamer

To force the use of the vlc player, specify:

  advene -pvlctypes

* Installing

To install the application, you can run the setup.py script with
appropriate options. For a standard installation, run

  python setup.py install

Note that it is not necessary to install the application to run it. It
can be used directly from its sources directory.

* Documentation

An (incomplete) user guide is in the public Advene wiki, feel free to contribute:

CHANGES.txt file.
