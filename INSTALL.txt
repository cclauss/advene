How to install the Advene prototype

* Requirements:

** Video player

The only supported cross-platform player for the moment is VLC through
a native VLC plugin. You have to install the python-vlc plugin (see
http://liris.cnrs.fr/advene/download/) to access movies.

Linux users may use the gstreamer framework, through the
python-gstreamer module (>= 0.10).

** Linux version

You will need the following python packages (the package names are from
Debian, they may slightly vary on other distributions) :

python >= 2.4
python-gtk2 (>=2.10)
python-glade2 (>=2.10)
python-xml (>=0.8.0)
python-cherrypy3 (>=3.0.0) [for convenience, a copy of cherrypy is included in
this Advene distribution]
python-simpletal (>=3.12) [for convenience, a copy of simpletal is included in
this Advene distribution] 

For the gstreamer plugin:
python-gst0.10
gstreamer0.10-plugins-base
gstreamer0.10-x
+ other gstreamer packages needed to decode various formats

Note that all these dependencies are already available in Debian and
in standard installations of the Ubuntu Feisty Fawn distribution.

** Windows version

You should install in this order (note the version numbers) :

Gtk/win32 v. >= 2.10 : http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/ (runtime environment)

Python    v. 2.4 : http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.4.4/Python-2.4.4.exe
[ From http://python.org/ ]

PyGtk for python2.4: http://www.pcpm.ucl.ac.be/~gustin/win32_ports/ [ From http://www.pygtk.org ]

PyXML 0.8 : http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.8.4.win32-py2.4.exe?download
[ From http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/ ]

CherryPy: http://download.cherrypy.org/cherrypy/3.0.1/ [for
convenience, a copy of cherrypy is included in this Advene
distribution]

SimpleTAL (>=3.12) :
http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/download.html [for
convenience, a copy of simpletal is included in this Advene
distribution]

VLC + python-vlc mediacontrol extension (cf
http://download.gna.org/advene/win32/ )

** Mac OS X version

From macports (http://www.macports.org/), install :

    * python24 [Note: after its install, make sure that
      /opt/local/bin/python exists, and that your path begins with
      /opt/local/bin. Else, the installation of the other packages
      could use the /usr/bin/python version]
    * py-gtk2
    * py-xml

You will also need the vlc.so python module to control VLC. You can
download a precompiled version for vlc0.8.6c/i3386 from
http://liris.cnrs.fr/advene/download/mac/vlc-bindings/ or compile it
by yourself (which is hard for vlc <= 0.8.6, and should work better
for vlc >= 0.9.0).

* Testing

You can run the script ./bin/advene directly from the source
directory. It will adapt its paths to its location.

In a first step, you can try the Advene application without movie player
support by using the "-pdummy" parameter :
advene -pdummy

To force the use of the gstreamer player, specify:
advene -pgstreamer

To force the use of the vlc player, specify:
advene -pvlcnative

* Installing

To install the application, you can run the setup.py script with
appropriate options. For a standard installation, run

python setup.py install

Note that it is not necessary to install the application to run it. It
can be used directly from its sources directory.

* Documentation

An (incomplete) user guide is in the public Advene wiki, feel free to contribute:

A summarized list of changes across versions is available in the
changelog (debian/changelog file).
