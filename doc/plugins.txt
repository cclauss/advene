Plugin architecture for Advene
------------------------------

Types of plugins
================

  * content-type handler (editor / viewer)
  * actions
  * importers
  * global methods

Location of plugins
===================

For the builtin core features: lib/advene/plugins

For the builtin GUI features: lib/advene/gui/plugins

For user-defined plugins: $HOME/.advene/plugins

Implementation
==============

A plugin is a module. It *must* have :
  * a name attribute
  * a register(controller=None) function

The register function is called, with the controller as parameter,
upon loading. It has to register the plugin's components in the Advene
infrastructure.
