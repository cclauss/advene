* Running from sources

If you want to run Advene from sources on win32, you will need to
install some additional packages:

    * Gtk/win32: gtk-dev-2.10.11-win32-1.exe [ from http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/ ]

    * Python v. 2.4: [ From http://python.org/ ]

    * PyGtk for python2.4: pygtk-2.10.6-1.win32-py2.4.exe [ From http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.10/ ]

    * PyXML: PyXML-0.8.4.win32-py2.4.exe [ From http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/ ]

    * Pycairo: pycairo-1.2.6-1.win32-py2.4.exe [ From http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pycairo/1.2/ ]

And eventually the application sources, downloaded from
http://liris.cnrs.fr/advene/download/index_en.html or from the
subversion repository svn://liris.cnrs.fr/dev/advene-project/trunk

The bin/advene python scripts tries to autodetect wether it is running
from a standard location (c:\Program Files\Advene on windows) or from
a development tree, and setups the right paths in the latter case.

To try the Advene interface without any video player, you can invoke
it with the -pdummy option, that selects a dummy video player.

* Webserver reactivity

The webserver reactivity problem is due to the interaction of the Gtk
GUI with threads in python. To alleviate this problem, we try to
mingle with an internal parameter of the python interpreter. You can
try to tweak the values of:
config.data.play_interval
and
config.data.noplay_interval
from the python evaluator, to find values that fit your computer. The
default value is 100. With a lower value, it seems to work better.
