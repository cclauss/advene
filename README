Advene prototype

* Requirements:

The only supported player for the moment is VLC through a CORBA
module. You have to install CORBA support for VLC (see
http://liris.cnrs.fr/advene/download/) to access movies.

You will need the following python packages :

python-gtk2 (>=2.0)
python-glade2 (>=2.0)
python-pyorbit (>=2.0)
python-xml (>=0.8.0)
python-simpletal (>=3.6)
python-imaging

* Testing

You can run the script bin/advene directly from the source
directory. It will adapt its paths to its location.

* Installing

To install the application, run the setup.py script with appropriate
options. For a standard installation, run

python setup.py install

* Documentation

An incomplete user guide is in doc/user.txt
