advene (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * New package format (.azp, for Advene Zip Package) allowing to embed
    resources (files) in packages. You can save old .xml files into .azp
    files to get them converted. For instance, 
    access to resources is done through the TALES expression 
    package/resources/style.css
    To use this resource in a TAL template, you can then use:
    <link tal:attributes="href package/resources/style.css/absolute_url" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
  
  * A filename extension (.azp or .xml) is automatically appended if not
    present.

  * New global method: related. Returns, for an annotation, its related
    annotation. It is a shortcut useful for the case of binary relations:
    annotation/related/id
    is equivalent to
    annotation/outgoingRelations/first/members/last/id

  * global methods can be defined by user plugins (in .advene/plugins
    directory) through controller.register_global_method
  
  * ! Moved config and preferences files to ~/.advene directory
    (UserDir/advene on Windows)

  * New annotation mimetype (application/x-advene-zone) which allows to
    define rectangular zones.

  * GUI: 
    * the treeview can be displayed by default on the right of the video
      window (replacing the less used, for now, URL stack window), see the
      preferences panel
    * a view notebook holds the popupaccumulator below the video. It allows
      to embed other views (timeline, treeview, transcription...) simply by
      drag and drop of the view toolbutton to the notebook
    * added an element creation toolbar
    * generic player control shortcuts are used
    * Edit/Preferences now allows to modify paths (data, movies, player, imagecache) (from Frank Wagner)
    * Imagecache saves files with a .png extension
    * The not_yet_available image is now loaded from share/pixmaps/notavailable.png
  
  * The dummy player now returns a running time

    * implemented CMML import

    * Add shortcut to edit an annotation: 'e' to edit the selected
      annotation (selection can be moved with arrow keys)
  
  * TranscriptionEdit: 
    * clicking on a mark now goes to the position. Use the popup menu to remove marks.
    * control-space now sets a mark and pauses the movie

  * Snapshot cache now saves files with a .png extension (from Frank Wagner)

  * Implemented plugin architecture (user-defined plugins in ~/.advene/plugins)

  * webserver:
    * message log is now available from the menu (View->Webserver log), and
      not displayed on the console
    * new action: /admin/halt (useful for the standalone case)
    * new action: /admin/methods displays the list of available TALES methods  
    * new path: /action/ActionName?param=TALESexpr to invoke actions defined
      in the ECA framework

  * Advene no longer depends on the Image module. It only uses it if image
    type conversion is necessary.
  
  * Advene now depends on gtk >= 2.6

  * Added spanish translations (courtesy of Emmanuel Ayala)
  * Bugfix in path initialization

  * Multiple instances can now run simultaneously (only the first instance
    activates its webserver)

  * evaluator: changed some shortcuts (see help), implemented expression history
