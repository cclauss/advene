Description: Annotate DVDs, Exchange on the Net.
 The Advene (Annotate DVd, Exchange on the NEt) project is aimed
 towards communities exchanging discourses (analysis, studies) about
 audiovisual documents (e.g. movies) in DVD format. This requires that
 audiovisual content and hypertext facilities be integrated, thanks to
 annotations providing explicit structures on  audiovisual streams, upon
 which hypervideo documents can be engineered.
 .
 The Advene framework provides models and tools allowing to design and reuse
 annotations schemas; annotate video streams according to these schemas;
 generate and create Stream-Time Based (mainly video-centred) or User-Time
 Based (mainly text-centred) visualisations of the annotations. Schemas
 (annotation- and relation-types), annotations and relations, queries and
 views can be clustered and shared in units called packages. Hypervideo
 documents are generated when needed, both from packages (for annotation and
 view description) and DVDs (audiovisual streams).
