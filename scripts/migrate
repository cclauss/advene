"""Data migration script.

It is intended to migrate data to a new template. The assumption is
that the template package (first parameter) has a old_id_mapping
metadata dict, that has original type ids as keys and new type ids as
values.

The template data structure is first merged into the source package.
Then old annotation types are checked: if they have a mapping defined
in old_id_mapping, then move their annotations to the new type, and
delete the original type.

Then save the resulting package with the original name plus
"_migrated" suffix.
